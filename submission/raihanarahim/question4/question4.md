# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Amirah Raihanah binti Abdul Rahim
#### Matric No.: A20EC0182
#### Dataset: Tweets

## Question 4 (a)
### Machine Learning approach on Tweets Dataset.
The machine learning method I chose is classification which is a supervised machine learning and I used K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm.

<br>

For my case study, I  focused on developing a classification model to determine whether tweets will become trending or not. To obtain the result, I use the feature selection technique to obtain the best features that can contirubute in classifying the tweets. Then, I define what it means by trending or not by using the engagement ratio between `favourites_count` / `followers_count`. 

<br>

The process involved are :
* `Data Cleaning` : The data has JSON format with '{}' and ',' thus data need to be clean to remove those unwanted characters.
* `Defining label for trending` : Defining what it means by trending by using this formula = `favourites_count` / `followers_count`.
* `Feature Selection` : The dataset has many attributes so I choose the ones that can be a feature to identify whether the tweet will be trending or not. This method contributes to obtaining the best result in developing the machine learning model.
* `Apply ML algorithm` : K-NN algorithm is chosen as it is the most suitable algorithm to classify tweets based on the label defined.
* `Analyze results` : After applying the algorithm, the results are analyzed to get insights from the dataset.
