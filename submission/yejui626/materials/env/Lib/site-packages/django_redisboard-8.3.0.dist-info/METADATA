Overview

Redis monitoring and inspection drop-in application using django admin.

* Free software: BSD 2-Clause License

Features
========

* Sever statistics in the admin changelist
* Key summary in the inspect view
* Value introspection with pagination for lists and sorted sets

Don't have a django project?
============================

If you just want to run redisboard quickly do this::

    pip install django-redisboard
    redisboard

Don't want to run on 0.0.0.0:8000? Run::

    redisboard ip:port

Want a password that ain't random (you might need to ``rm -rf ~/.redisboard`` first tho)? Run::

    redisboard --password=foobar

Installation guide
==================

Install from pypi, with pip::

    pip install django-redisboard

Add ``redisboard`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

::

    INSTALLED_APPS += ("redisboard", )

After that you need to run::

    manage.py migrate

Then you can add redis servers in the admin. You will see the stats in the changelist.

Redisboard has few css tweaks for the pages (they are optional). If you use staticfiles just run::

    manage.py collectstatic

If you do not use django.contrib.staticfiles you must manually symlink the
site-packages/redisboard/static/redisboard dir to <your media root>/redisboard.

Optional Django settings
========================

======================================= ====
Setting name                            Description
======================================= ====
``REDISBOARD_CONNECTION_POOL_OPTIONS``  Extra connection options. Default: ``{}``. Example:

                                        .. sourcecode:: python

                                            REDISBOARD_CONNECTION_POOL_OPTIONS = {'socket_timeout': 60, 'socket_connect_timeout': 10}


``REDISBOARD_DECODER_CLASS``            Default: ``'redisboard.data.UTF8BackslashReplaceDecoder'``.
``REDISBOARD_DISPLAY_CLASS``            Default: ``'redisboard.data.TabularDisplay'``.
``REDISBOARD_VALUE_QUERY_CLASS``        Default: ``'redisboard.data.ValueQuery'``.
``REDISBOARD_LENGTH_QUERY_CLASS``       Default: ``'redisboard.data.LengthQuery'``.
``REDISBOARD_DETAIL_FILTERS``           A list of regular expressions to match against the keys in the server
                                        details colum. Eg, to only show uptime and list of active databases:

                                        .. sourcecode:: python

                                            REDISBOARD_DETAIL_FILTERS = ['uptime.*', 'db.*']

                                        To show all the details just use:

                                        .. sourcecode:: python

                                            REDISBOARD_DETAIL_FILTERS = ['.*']
``REDISBOARD_DETAIL_CONVERTERS``        Mapping of regexes to functions to convert those values. Checkout the sourcecode for what's
                                        available.
``REDISBOARD_SLOWLOG_NUM``              Number of slowlog entries to show. Default: ``10``.
``REDISBOARD_SCAN_COUNT``               Count used for the various scan commands. Affects pagination for key list and key details.
                                        Default: ``1000``.
``REDISBOARD_STRING_PAGINATION``        Count used just for paginating string values. Default: ``10000``

Changelog
=========

8.3.0 (2022-05-20)
------------------

* Added a bunch of links to Change/Inspect/Details in various pages and cleaned up code some more.
* Improved simplified/styling a bit.

8.2.2 (2022-05-19)
------------------

* Fix broken missing key check for databases different than the default one (usually 0) and render a full page instead of a text/plain 404.

8.2.1 (2022-05-18)
------------------

* Fixed issue with key stats being empty for databases different than the default one (usually 0). Turns out pipelines open up a new
  connection and need a select call.

8.2.0 (2022-05-17)
------------------

* Added a full details page.
* Added some headings in inspect pages.
* Fixed model name in breadcrumbs.
* Fixed empty media in inspect pages.
* Fixed inspect page giving 500 error for unavailable servers.

8.1.0 (2022-05-16)
------------------

* Added ``--version`` CLI option.
* Changed redisboard CLI admin header to show version and also fixed incorrect context that prevented AdminSite customizations overriding
  said header. Probably view site link also fixed.


8.0.1 (2022-05-15)
------------------

* Fixed incorrect settings loading of ``REDISBOARD_DETAIL_CONVERTERS``.

8.0.0 (2022-05-15)
------------------

* Dropped support for Python 3.6.
* Overhauled internals to support customization of redis queries, deserialization and display using custom classes.
  For that purpose there are new settings: ``REDISBOARD_DECODER_CLASS``, ``REDISBOARD_DISPLAY_CLASS``, ``REDISBOARD_VALUE_QUERY_CLASS`` and
  ``REDISBOARD_LENGTH_QUERY_CLASS``.
* Fixed various issues with pagination by simplifying it and making the use of cursors transparent to the user.
  For this purpose the ``sampling_size`` and ``sampling_threshold`` models fields have been removed, and the ``REDISBOARD_ITEMS_PER_PAGE``
  was removed and replaced with ``REDISBOARD_SCAN_COUNT`` and ``REDISBOARD_STRING_PAGINATION``.
* Added new setting ``REDISBOARD_DETAIL_CONVERTERS`` for customizing display of server details somewhat.
* Added new setting ``REDISBOARD_SLOWLOG_NUM`` option for limiting the slowlow displayed.
* The default value for the ``REDISBOARD_DETAIL_FILTERS`` setting was changed.
* Better connection management was implemented, both via render callbacks and ``__del__`` (as a fallback).
  There shouldn't be any connection leaks anymore. If the DEBUG setting is True then warnings
  will be issued should any connection be closed via ``__del__``.
* Added the ``--debug`` (to enable DEBUG and autoreload) and ``--decoder`` (to load a different data decoder) in the ``redisboard`` CLI.

7.0.1 (2022-05-12)
------------------

* Fixed ``--password`` killing the django session (it won't change the password and invalidate session if it's identical).
* Fixed some alignment regressions in the table cells.

7.0.0 (2022-05-12)
------------------

* Removed some of the more expensive and frankly pointless stats computations.
* Fixed internal error that occurred for empty databases.
* Cleaned up more code (hopefully all the Python 2 is all gone now).
* Changed the inspect page to include all the stats from the changelist.
* Changed the stats display to use tables instead of definition lists.
* Changed the ``--password`` CLI option to update the password regardless if the local sqlite was created or not.


6.0.0 (2022-04-12)
------------------

* Replaced the hostname/port fields with an url field.
  This allow SSL connection and whatever Redis will have in the future.
* Removed more dead code.

5.0.0 (2022-01-27)
------------------

* Drop support for old Python/Django. Minimum requirements are now Python 3.6 and Django 2.2.
* Fixed various issues with newer Django (up to 4.0):

  * Fixed various deprecations and broken imports.
  * Added a ``default_auto_field`` - fixes Django complaining about missing migrations if you have a custom ``DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD``
    in settings.

4.1.1 (2020-07-28)
------------------

* Improved exception handling for errors coming from redis. Now timeouts show the server as "DOWN" and other errors
  don't result in a 500 page.

4.1.0 (2020-07-23)
------------------

* Fixed a KeyError that could occur on fast changing databases.

  (migrations will run now).

  in `#33 <https://github.com/ionelmc/django-redisboard/pull/33>`_.
* Converted the ``run_redisboard.py`` script to a ``redisboard`` bin and fixed Django 2.x issues.

* Dropped support for Python older than 3.4 or 2.7.
* Fixed issues with data being displayed as binary strings.
* Fixed unwanted tag escaping. Contributed by Gilles Lavaux
  in `#37 <https://github.com/ionelmc/django-redisboard/pull/37>`_.

3.0.2 (2017-01-19)
------------------

* Fixed UnicodeDecodeError in "redisboard/admin.py" (fixes
  issue `#15 <https://github.com/ionelmc/django-redisboard/issues/15>`_).

------------------

* Fix error handling in couple places. Now pages don't return 500 errors if there's something bad going on with the
  redis connection.
* Remove key stats that came from ``DEBUG OBJECT`` (LRU, Address, Length etc). Now ``OBJECT
  [REFCOUNT|ENCODING|IDLETIME]`` is used instead. **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE**

1.2.2 (2015-10-11)
------------------

* Exception handling for AWS ElastiCache Redis or any Redis that does not have DEBUG OBJECT command.
* Enabled Redis keys to be inspected despite not having details from DEBUG OBJECT command.
