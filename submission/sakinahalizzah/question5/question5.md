## Question 5 (a)

Optimizing portal performance is essential when working with a large amount of JSON data that requires display on a dashboard. To achieve this, consider the following approach as a recommendation:

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Aggregation

When creating a dashboard, it is critical to thoroughly analyze the requirements and identify the essential data that needs to be visualized. To achieve this, the JSON data must be preprocessed to extract and transform the relevant information needed for the dashboard. This can be done by aggregating the data to reduce its volume and complexity. Summarizing or grouping the data appropriately can avoid unnecessary details during visualization. For example, consider the aggregation of data in an accounts dataset using MongoDB.

The output of group by limit and sort the count in descending order.

### 2. Data Indexing

For optimal performance in retrieving and filtering JSON data, it is highly recommended to establish indexes on the commonly used query fields. This process greatly decreases the time it takes to execute queries and improves the overall efficiency of the database. MongoDB, for instance, offers the Index function in MongoDB Compass, which is a user-friendly way to create indexes. By utilizing this feature, you can easily and conveniently create indexes that will enhance the performance of your MongoDB database.
